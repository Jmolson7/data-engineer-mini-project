## üì• Overview

Welcome to **data-engineer-mini-project**. This mini ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline helps you transform data from a CSV file into a SQLite database. You can then run SQL queries and perform analytics using pandas. It's beginner-friendly and perfect for building your data engineering portfolio.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps to download and run the software.

### 1. System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Software:** Python 3.6 or higher
- **Database:** SQLite (comes included)
- **Packages:** pandas, SQLite3 (automatically installed)
